# Deep Learning & Computer Vision Labs

This repository contains a collection of hands-on labs focused on **deep learning** and **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**.  
It includes **Google Colab Notebooks** (Jupyter nb) and **datasets** to help you experiment with key concepts in modern computer vision.

## Contents

- 📘 Deep learning practice notebooks
    
- 📂 Datasets for training and evaluation
    

## Goals

- Build intuition for neural networks
    
- Apply CNNs to real image-processing problems
    
- Explore and experiment with common deep learning workflows
